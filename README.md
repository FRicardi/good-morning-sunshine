GPT_API_KEY=<your open ai key>
```

## Resources usage

### Fonts
We are using the font ["LuckiestGuy"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy), found on google fonts. Since Jimp accepts only bitmap fonts, we've used [ttf2fnt](https://ttf2fnt.com/) and placed the outcome on this repository. There is no comercial use intent.
